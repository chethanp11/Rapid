The execution of this control is documented in the `recon_log.csv` file, which tracks each break's details, including the Break ID, Value Date, Currency, Amount, Root Cause, Status, and whether it was escalated.\n\n#### Evidence of Control Execution:\n1. **Execution Logs**: The `recon_log.csv` file contains detailed logs of each Nostro break from 2025-05-01 to 2025-05-05. For example:\n   - Break ID BRK-1001 was unresolved and escalated.\n   - Break ID BRK-1004 was pending and escalated due to being unresolved past the 48-hour threshold.\n\n2. **Escalation Evidence**: An escalation email dated 2025-05-04 was sent by Amit Kumar, Reconciliation Analyst, to the operations supervisor and risk controls team, regarding the unresolved break BRK-1004, as per SOP section 4. The email is documented in `email.txt`.\n\n3. **Analyst Notes**: The `notes.txt` file includes notes confirming the resolution and escalation status of breaks, such as the escalation of BRK-1004 on 2025-05-04.\n\n4. **Test Results**: The `test_results.csv` file shows that the escalation process was tested and passed, confirming that breaks over the threshold trigger the appropriate escalation.\n\n#### Control Review and Signoff:\nThe control review process is conducted as per the guidelines in the `master_sop.md`. The review ensures completeness and proper execution of the control, with unresolved exceptions being escalated as required.\n\n#### Exception Handling:\nAccording to the SOP, any unresolved break over 48 hours must be escalated to the Operations Head. The escalation of BRK-1004 was conducted in compliance with this rule.\n\n#### Supporting Artifacts:\n- `recon_log.csv`: Contains detailed logs of Nostro breaks.\n- `email.txt`: Contains the escalation email for unresolved breaks.\n- `notes.txt`: Provides analyst notes on break resolutions and escalations.\n- `test_results.csv`: Documents the testing of the escalation process.\n\n#### Frequency of Execution:\nThe Nostro break review is executed daily, as evidenced by the daily logs in `recon_log.csv`.\n\n#### Line of Defense:\nThe Nostro break review process is primarily a 1LoD activity, with oversight and escalation involving the 2LoD.\n\nThis response provides a complete and factual account of the evidence for the daily review and escalation of Nostro breaks, as requested in RFI-0001.",

    "response": "**RFI Response: Escalation Evidence for Unresolved Nostro Breaks**\n\n**RFI Title:** Escalation Evidence for Unresolved Nostro Breaks  \n**Project Name:** PRJ-1234_Nostro_Recon_Control\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThis response provides evidence of control execution for the escalation and tracking of unresolved Nostro breaks exceeding the 48-hour threshold, as requested in the RFI. The evidence is drawn from available project documentation and corresponds to the control requirements outlined in the SOP.\n\n**Evidence of Escalation and Tracking:**\n\n1. **Escalation Triggered for BRK-1004:**\n   - **Email Documentation:** An email dated 2025-05-04 from Amit Kumar, a Reconciliation Analyst, was sent to the operations supervisor and copied to the risk controls team. The subject was \"Escalation - Unresolved Nostro Break (BRK-1004).\" The email confirms that the Nostro break under ID BRK-1004 remained unresolved past the 48-hour threshold and was escalated according to SOP section 3.4. The email also mentions that reconciliation logs and analyst notes were attached for reference. (Source: email.txt)\n\n2. **Reconciliation Notes:**\n   - **Notes Documentation:** The notes from 2025-05-04 confirm that BRK-1004 remained unresolved and was escalated to the supervisor on the same day. The notes also mention that evidence of the escalation is available in the escalation email. (Source: notes.txt)\n\n3. **Reconciliation Log:**\n   - **Log Documentation:** The `recon_log.csv` file shows that BRK-1004, with a value date of 2025-05-04 and an amount of GBP 250.00, was marked as \"Pending\" and escalated (\"Yes\" under the Escalated? column). This confirms the unresolved status and escalation action. (Source: recon_log.csv)\n\n4. **Testing Evidence:**\n   - **Test Results:** The `test_results.csv` file includes test case TC-002, which demonstrates that the escalation is triggered when a break exceeds the threshold. This test case passed, confirming that the escalation control is functioning as expected. (Source: test_results.csv)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe evidence provided demonstrates that the escalation process for unresolved Nostro breaks exceeding 48 hours is executed and tracked in compliance with the SOP. The documentation includes email correspondence, reconciliation notes, logs, and test results, all of which support the proper functioning of the escalation controls for the project PRJ-1234_Nostro_Recon_Control.\n\nPlease let us know if further information or additional documentation is required.",

    "response": "### RFI Response for RFI-0007 \u2013 Clarify Control Classification for Break Monitoring\n\n#### Project Name and ID: \nPRJ-5678_Manual_Journal_Control\n\n#### Control Classification Justification:\nThe Break Monitoring control is implemented as a **detective control** rather than a preventive control. This decision aligns with the control's purpose and operational context, as outlined below:\n\n1. **Control Definition and Purpose**:\n   - According to the `controls_glossary.md`, a detective control is designed to identify issues **after they occur** by monitoring outcomes or records. Break Monitoring fits this definition as it tracks and identifies exceptions or breaks in the journal entry review process.\n\n2. **Control Execution and Monitoring**:\n   - The control operates on a T+1 review basis due to system limitations, as noted in `notes.txt`. This means that journal entries are reviewed the day after they are posted, which inherently makes it a detective process.\n   - Execution logs, such as `entry_log.csv`, document the status and review of journal entries. For instance, entries like JE-003 and JE-005 were flagged for pending review, demonstrating the control's role in identifying post-facto issues.\n\n3. **Exception Handling and Escalation**:\n   - The SOP (`master_sop.md`, Section 4) specifies that unresolved breaks must be escalated within 48 hours. The email from Anita Rao (found in `email.txt`) confirms adherence to this process, as she communicated the delayed review of JE-003 due to her leave and completed the review upon return.\n\n4. **Framework Alignment**:\n   - The RBI Operational Risk Guidelines (`risk_frameworks.md`) emphasize the importance of incident management and exception handling, which supports the use of Break Monitoring as a detective control. This aligns with the framework's focus on daily operations and periodic risk reviews by the 1LoD and 2LoD.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**:\n   - Test results in `test_results.csv` confirm the control's effectiveness in identifying and escalating exceptions, such as delayed reviews or entries without approvers. All scenarios tested, including TC-002 for delayed review, passed successfully.\n\n#### Evidence and Artifacts:\n- **Execution Logs**: `entry_log.csv`\n- **Approval and Escalation Emails**: `email.txt`\n- **Notes on Control Operation**: `notes.txt`\n- **Testing Results**: `test_results.csv`\n- **SOP Reference**: `master_sop.md`, Section 4\n\n#### Frequency of Execution:\n- The control is executed on a daily basis, with reviews typically completed within 24 hours of posting, as indicated in the `notes.txt`.\n\n#### Reviewer and Escalation:\n- The control review is conducted by Anita Rao, as documented in `entry_log.csv` and `email.txt`. Any unresolved exceptions are escalated according to the SOP guidelines.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive justification for the classification of Break Monitoring as a detective control, supported by documented evidence and aligned with regulatory frameworks.",
