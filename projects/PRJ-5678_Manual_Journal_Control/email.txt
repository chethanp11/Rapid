Dear Team,

Apologies for the delay in reviewing JE-003. I was on planned leave from 3-May to 5-May and have now completed the review.

Entry has been approved and noted in the control log.

Let me know if this needs to be escalated further or documented in exception log.

Regards,  
Anita Rao  
Senior Financial Controller
